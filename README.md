To run CancerModel.py, open your favorite IDE or run it from the command line. On a Mac, make sure you have Python 2.7 installed. Download and save the program to a place on your computer. Run the program by typing "Python [path_to_file]" in the command line. It takes about 30 seconds to run. 

To change variables like the maximum number of iterations and rates of cancer and normal cell divison, open the program and and edit lines 90, 131, and 147. The variables for rates of cancer and normal cell divison can be changed by editing the range of numbers the random.randint() function will draw from. For example, changing line 90 from "0<= divide <= 3" to "if 0<= divide <= 4" would increase the probability of a new normal cell will have an increased chance of probability.
